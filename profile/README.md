# <span style="color:#2b6cb0">From Multi-View to Multiple Learning Strategies</span>

**Multi-Learn** is a research and development initiative that explores a wide spectrum of learning paradigms in machine learning;
with a historical focus on **multi-view learning**. Today, **Multi-Learn** encompasses a broader set of challenges including multimodal integration, synthetic data generation, single-image learning, and large-scale segmentation.
It serves as a hub for interoperable tools and benchmarks designed to support reproducible research and scalable machine learning workflows. Key software and datasets developed under **Multi-Learn** it now addresses broader challenges such as:


- **Multimodal integration**
- **Synthetic data generation**
- **Single-image learning**
- **Large-scale segmentation**

It serves as a hub for **interoperable tools** and **reproducible benchmarks**, enabling scalable ML workflows.

### üß∞ Key Projects and Resources

- **Summit** (*Supervised MultiModal Integration Tool*): A framework to benchmark mono- and multi-view classifiers on custom datasets.
- **scikit-multimodallearn**: A Python package (scikit-learn compatible) for multimodal data classification.
- **MAGE** (*Multi-view Artificial Generation Engine*): A toolkit to generate synthetic multi-view datasets for controlled experimentation.
- **Multimodal Protein Dataset**: A dataset and toolkit for classifying highly multi-functional proteins using multimodal biological data.
- **LIS¬≤** (*Large Image Split Segmentation*): A toolbox for large-scale, single-image semantic segmentation.
